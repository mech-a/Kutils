# Kutils
An assortment of scripts to manage data important to K-pop communities, including a Twitter fansite activity checker and YouTube dead link checker, with Google Sheets integration.

In early development stages, not packaged for distribution.

## Developer Setup
To set up Kutils on a local system, it requires a system environment variable named *KUTILS_PVT* pointing to a folder 
that contains your auth tokens. Specifically, a JSON file containing a service account login with Sheets v4 and YouTube 
Data v3 authorization named *tester-google-credentials.json* must be present in the folder at *KUTILS_PVT*.
